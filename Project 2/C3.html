<p>You took the minecart down the rails and it stops after sloping downhill for sometime. You get out and look around for a way out.</p>
<p>Eventually, you find a key on the ground. Nearby, there's a black door on the left that is closed and locked, and another brown door on the right, slightly ajar.</p>
<p>Which door should you take?</p>

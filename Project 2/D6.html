<p>You passed through the unlocked door on the right.</p>
<p>You come into a small room with a fireplace, some chairs around a table, and a bookcase. As you look around, you find a white door opposite the door you came through. </p>
<p>You also toy around with the bookcase and pull some books out. The bookcase begins to rotate to reveal a large dark opening.</p>
<p>Which route do you take?</p>
